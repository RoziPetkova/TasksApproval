<!--A fragment in SAPUI5 is like a UI snippet (a reusable piece of UI), but without its own
controller or lifecycle.
You can think of a fragment as a partial view:
- It contains UI controls (XML, JS, or HTML).
- It has no onInit, onExit lifecycle methods (unlike a View).
- It's always used inside a View or Controller.-->

<!--fragments
do not have a controller this attribute is missing. Also, the fragment does not have 
any footprint in the DOM tree of the app, 
and there is no control instance of the fragment itself (only the contained controls).-->

<!-- xmlns and xml:core -> namespaces of sap libraries -->
<!--Everything
inside this tag is part of the fragment, which can be loaded and used in views or controllers.-->
